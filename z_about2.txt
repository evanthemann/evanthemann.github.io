*** Copy and paste this into second paragraph of about me ***

This website is one of many places to find me on the web. My favorite thing is my Edit with Evan channel (which I don't upkeep as well as I should, nor do I have good organization, but I like it). Check out my YouTube for my current personal stuff or Vimeo for more formal stuff. Ok dammit here's my Facebook and Instagram too to show I'm not trying to hide anything. OK and my Twitter. You happy?
