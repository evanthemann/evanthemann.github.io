		<p>My name is Evan Mann. I am passionate about multimedia, technology, communication and marketing. Currently I work for SAS Institute as an Associate Communications Specialist in the Internal Communications department. My main day-to-day responsibility is editing videos for internal use. These videos are usually interviews, department updates, instructional videos, event coverage, or creative narrative videos.</p>
