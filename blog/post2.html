          <p>The trip started promptly at 5:00 pm on Friday, when I picked Jess up from her work. We had already packed all our gear, so it was just a matter of tossing it in the trunk and hitting the road. Immediately we were stopped in standstill rush-hour traffic. It didn’t help that it was pouring rain, and being early-December, it was already dark outside.</p>

          <p>Finally we made it out of the city, and headed west on highway 64 towards High Point, where we would pick up our teardrop trailer.</p>

          <p>The campsite we booked for Friday night had a policy that you had to check in by 7:30pm. Our ETA to pickup the trailer was 7:20pm, and the campsite was 10 minutes away from there. So, we called the campsite asking for them to make an exception. They weren’t thrilled at the idea, and said they really needed us there by 7:30, but the absolute latest we could arrive would be 8:00pm.</p>

          <p>Through the pouring night rain we stressed about our ETA. We arrived at the house to pick up the trailer at 7:13 pm. The gentleman who we were renting from was there waiting. He walked me through the trailer and it’s parts, while Jess called the campsite to tell them we would make it soon.</p>

          <p>Finally, we pulled in to the campsite, with our trailer at 7:50pm. The attendant was there waiting, and even helped me back the trailer in to the spot. By 8:00pm, we had the trailer in the spot, and we took a sigh of relief.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Night in the Teardrop</h2>

          <p>We had planned to cook, but it was still cold and rainy, and we were exhausted from the stress of getting there on time, so we didn’t. We unhooked the trailer, and took the car to a nearby brewery. We had a code to get in and out of the campsite gate as we needed.</p>

          <p>After a delicious (well-deserved) meal at Liberty brewery in High Point, we made it back to the camper and set up for the night. We turned on the electric heater, and anxiously waited. A few minutes later, we were sheltered from the cold rainy elements inside our cozy, warm, teardrop trailer. Now we were glamping. We put on a movie and went to sleep.</p>

          <p>At 6AM we woke up, hitched up the trailer, and took off for Beech Mountain. It was still dark when we left, and the rain was still going strong.</p>

          <p>When the sun finally rose, we stopped for breakfast at the wilkesboro chic fila. We tried calling our campground to check in early, but didn’t get an answer. We drove the final windy roads up the last bit of the mountain. At 9:00, we made it to Beech mountains just as it was opening.</p>

          <p>The fog at the top of the mountain was thick. Apparently there’s a nice view up there, but we didn’t see it.</p>
          
          <p>The base was nice, and now it was looking more like sleet than rain.</p>
          
          <p>Then, it was definitely snowing.</p>
          
          <p>The campground had called and let us know we could check in early. Unsure how long it would last and how the roads would be, we took a lunch break to drive the trailer down the mountain.</p>
          
          <p>Got the trailer set up and went to Dunn’s Deli for lunch. Great food cheaper than the resort food.</p>
          
          <p>We got back to Beech and kept going until 5:00pm when our day pass was up.</p>
          
          <p>We took our final lift up before 5 and went to the Beech Mountain Brewery at the top of the mountain.</p>
          
          <p>After a beer there it was dark, foggy and sleeting as we headed down the mountain for our last run.</p>
          
          <p>We left the mountain and stopped at Food Lion on our way back to the campsite. For dinner, we made sausage and veggie foil packs.</p>
          
          <p>Still raining and windy outside, weather conditions weren’t that nice. We got the fire going with the starter log and I cooked dinner while Jess set up the inside of the teardrop as a table for dinner.</p>
          
          <p>We had a nice dinner of vegetables and sausages. And wine.</p>
          
          <p>After dinner we started playing cards, but soon after Jess said she was tired and fell asleep. While she slept, I read my book, and eventually got comfortable enough to fall asleep myself. We both woke up around 1:00am and took showers in the campsite bathrooms. The campsite bathrooms were very luxury, with plenty of steaming hot water.</p>      
          
          <p>We watched the movie on my iPad (Fun Mom Dinner, great movie) and fell asleep.</p>
          
          <p>The next morning we took our time waking up and cleaning up the trailer and the campsite. Once everything was cleaned up and put away, we hooked up the trailer to the car and drove a mile down the road to Grandview restaurant.</p>
          
          <p>A delicious diner style brunch was just what we needed, and this meal really hit the spot.</p>
          
          <p>From the restaurant, we hit the road to High Point. We arrived to drop off the trailer at about 3 PM, and headed home.</p>
          
          <p>We got home at about 4:30 on Sunday afternoon with plenty of time to enjoy the evening before work the next day. The trip was a huge success and I had a great time.</p>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
