    <h2 class="w3-wide">Building a pallet shed</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>How I built a shed with free pallets.</i></p>
    <p>In planning this, I looked at every example I could find on YouTube and Pinterest, while collecting pallets from Craigslist for free. As I collected the pallets, I kept a list of each pallet and the size. I knew I wanted to put my 4 wheeler and lawn mower inside, so I measured those as well. </p>
    <p>
      A trip to home depot kicked off the official building phase.
      I bought 15 cinder blocks, a decision I second-guessed but eventually conceded to when there were exactly 15 cinder blocks left on the shelf. It was fate. They were heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So heavy, in fact, that when I got home, I drove my car around back so I could just throw them on the ground straight from the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set them out as I planned, 5 wide and 3 long. I took the two floor pallets to the back yard the same way, taking advantage of the fact that I don’t care about my lawn by driving all over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I set down the pallets, I realized I had to rearrange the cinder blocks to match the structural beams of the pallets.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had the layout correct, came the part I was dreading: leveling the cinder blocks.
      Maybe I should’ve put rocks down below everything, but I didn’t. I wanted to get this done today, I’d procrastinated long enough. I got them all level and put the pallets down, the floor pallets looked great!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it turned out it was going to rain the next day. I didn’t want to let the pallets get rained on, so i brought them inside.
      Back in the garage, but now they were in the other half of my garage, blocking access to my workbench. I had to get these out of my garage. The whole point of this project is to get more space in my garage by having a place for the 4 wheeler and lawn mower, but now I just have tons of pallets. I need to get moving on this project.
      So, I need a roof. Once I have a roof there, I can leave it outside, protected even if it rains. I found some metal panels at Home Depot for $5 a piece, so I got four of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally a sunny day came when I had some free time at lunch. I got out the Mitre Saw and began cutting the pieces of 2 by 4 which would hold the roof at an angle. I used the back porch as my cutting station. A 2 degree angle slope. I used math to figure out the lengths I needed. You ever just use math?
    </p>
    <p>After cutting the supports, I tested them out. Holy shit it actually works! Math!</p>
    <p>So now it’s time to bring the other 2 pallets, same size as the floor pallets, out for the roof. I brought them out and laid them on top of the floor. My plan was to attach the roof panels, then prop up the roof on the floor using those 2 by 4 pieces.</p>
    <p>I placed the panels on to see how it would look. Had some overhang and about 3 inches of overlap between panels. </p>
    <p>
      With that all laid out, I go ahead and put some screws in there. I bought screws meant for this roofing, so they have little rubber washers so water can’t go through. I drilled pilot holes and screwed them in. I put them on the higher part of the ridges because that way less water will pass them.
    </p>
    <p>Now, I had to put the 2 by 4 supports under each support beam of the pallet. I didn’t plan great here, because I couldn’t reach the inner beams, and this thing was pretty heavy at this point. So I had to lift it up and flip it over. </p>
    <p>
      But with it flipped over like this, I realized I also have to bolt together the 2 pallets. So first, I connected the angled 2 by 4 pieces to the pallet support beam (which is a 2 by 4) I used scrap wood to simply hold the 2 by 4 in place everywhere. I’ll take off this piece of scrap wood later, but it works enough to just hold the 2 by 4 in place.
    </p>
    <p>Then I bolted the 2 pallets together in 4 places.</p>
    <p>I put the roof back on the floor and lined up all the pieces, and it looked good! </p>
    <p>Finally, I cut a good amount off the front roof overhang using shears. Now it’s ready to be rained on. I’m calling it a day.</p>
    <p>A few days later, I had time to work on the walls. I had to cut a few pallets to a smaller size, so I got out the circular saw and went to work. </p>
    <p>I had to cut a few of them in half widthwise, and one in half lengthwise. When I was done, I had the rough look of each wall. The two identical side walls. </p>
    <p>And the back wall.</p>
    <p>Next up is cutting the pieces that will be the sides of the front wall. I need enough space in the middle for the 4 wheeler and lawn mower to go through, so I had to make the side front pieces smaller than in my original plan sketch. </p>
    <p>I came across a free pallet on Craigslist, and it looked really useful. So i got it. I had been planning on buying some 2by4s to use as support structures for the roof. Sort of like rafters. This pallet will do that perfectly. </p>
    <p>I took apart the pallet and had 3 12ft 2 by 4s. I cut those in half to have 6 6ft 2 by 4s. The shed is 6ft wide so that’s perfect. </p>
    <p>Next up is to bolt the walls together. Using 3.5inch hex bolts, im securing the pallets together for each wall. First step is to lay them all out. </p>
    <p>All walls bolted together and calling it a day. </p>
    <p>The upcoming week had 4 days without rain in the forecast, so this was a good chance to put up the walls. First step is to remove the roof.</p>
    <p>I bolted together the walls, but to secure them to the floor, I’m just planning to use 3 inch deck screws. They weight should hold them down, these screws are just to hold it all in place. </p>
    <p>To put up each wall, I just set it on the edge of the floor, then screwed the 2 by 4 in at several places, trying to screw it into the 2 by 4 on the floor pallet as much as possible. </p>
    <p>Then, when putting up the other walls, I also screwed the sides to each other to keep them together more sturdy.</p>
    <p>All the walls are up, so now I need to put the rafters (?) up. These are two 2by4s on top of each other. This will distribute the weight of the roof better among the side walls. </p>
    <p>Now time to put the roof back on. It was heavy.</p>
    <p>With the roof on, now I had to measure and cut the final two support pieces for the middle roof rafter. I didn’t get any pictures of cutting them, but you can see them on top of the middle rafter here. </p>
    <p>I put screws in as many places as possible on the roof and support pieces, and it felt solid. That’s it for today. </p>
