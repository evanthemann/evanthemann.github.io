My passion is making videos. I provide the most value by taking a real puzzle of an interview and turning it into a cohesive story. I have a corporate style of high-quality subtleties over flashiness. I like to edit most but I also enjoy cinematography. I like to shoot everything I edit when possible. My current job as a Senior Communications Specialist at SAS Software requires me to do a lot more than just video production and video editing. My other responsibilities include proect management, writing, web administration, web design, graphic design, asset management.
